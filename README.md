# Ping Stack with ElasticSearch SIEM
#### Built by Ryan Ivis with Ping Identity

This project is being used to build out a side-car demo 'SIEM' that will consume ping logs and provide pre-canned dashboards. It is under active development.  

THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION. THERE ARE DEFAULT PASSWORDS THAT MUST BE MODIFIED.  


Demo Ping Fed Dashboard (threat intel and other enrichments coming soon)

------------

Configure .env file in root directory first!
------------
`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=es`   
`ELASTIC_VERSION=7.6.0`  
`ELASTIC_SECURITY=true`  
`ELASTIC_PASSWORD=2FederateM0re`  
`CERTS_DIR=/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certificates`  
`PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER={YOUR DEVOPS USER NAME HERE}`  
`PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY={YOUR DEVOPS KEY HERE}`  

------------

Important Notes
- Do not update the above elastic password without first updating the same password within the logstash pipeline as well as bootstraping scripts for elasticsearch found in the corrisponding sub folders.  


Configure your local docker client with at least 8GB Ram and 4CPU.
Go get'em cowboy/girl!!!

This will spin up a demo lab for Ping Fed / Directory / etc images.
Along with a ElasticSearch 2 Node Stack + Kibana + Logstash.

# Server Profiles

Ping Identity Server Profiles are used to provide the configuration, data, environment details to Ping Identity Docker Images.

## Playground Server Profiles

There is a Github Repository containing samples, experimental, training types of server profiles that may be created to help with examples and getting started projects. These are guaranteed to be documented as they are often one off examples of different concepts. Some of these products include:

| Server Profile | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [PingFed Cluster](https://github.com/pingidentity/server-profile-pingidentity-playground/tree/master/getting-started-pingfederate-cluster) | Configuring a PingFed cluster with admin/engine nodes |
