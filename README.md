# Ping Stack with ElasticSearch SIEM
#### Built by Ryan Ivis with Ping Identity

This project is being used to build out a side-car demo 'SIEM' that will consume ping logs and provide pre-canned dashboards. It is under active development.  

THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION. THERE ARE DEFAULT PASSWORDS THAT MUST BE MODIFIED.  


Demo Ping Fed Dashboard

Threat Intel and TOR Endpoints are being provided by AlienVault and the TOR Network Endpoint List.
Threat Feeds are updated every 2000 seconds!!!

------------
YOU MUST!!
Configure .env file in root directory first for this to work!!!
ALSO ENSURE YOU HAVE 8GB RAM AND 3-4 CPU ALLOCATED FOR DOCKER.
TESTED ON UBUNTU LINUX AS WELL AS MACOS DOCKER
------------
`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=es`   
`ELASTIC_VERSION=7.6.0`  
`ELASTIC_SECURITY=true`  
`ELASTIC_PASSWORD=2FederateM0re`  
`CERTS_DIR=/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certificates`  
`PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER={YOUR DEVOPS USER NAME HERE}`  
`PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY={YOUR DEVOPS KEY HERE}`  

------------

Important Notes
- Do not update the above elastic password without first updating the same password within the logstash pipeline as well as bootstraping scripts.   for elasticsearch found in the corrisponding sub folders.   


Configure your local docker client with at least 8GB Ram and 4CPU.  
Go get'em cowboy/girl!!!  

This will spin up a demo lab for Ping Fed / Directory / etc images.  
Along with a ElasticSearch 2 Node Stack + Kibana + Logstash.  

------------
## Kibana Saved Objects
Saved Objects can be loaded by going to 'saved objects' under kibana settings and exporting all. Save the file in the...  
./elasticsearch-siem/kibana_config/kib_base.ndjson.  

They will be reloaded upon Kibana Start!!!

# Server Profiles

Ping Identity Server Profiles are used to provide the configuration, data, environment details to Ping Identity Docker Images.

| Server Profile | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Getting Started](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles/tree/master/getting-started) | Ping Identity products with basic install/config |

| [Simple Sync](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles/tree/master/simple-sync) | DataSync server sync'ing between two PingDirectory trees |

## Playground Server Profiles

There is a Github Repository containing samples, experimental, training types of server profiles that may be created to help with examples and getting started projects. These are guaranteed to be documented as they are often one off examples of different concepts. Some of these products include:

| Server Profile | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [PingFed Cluster](https://github.com/pingidentity/server-profile-pingidentity-playground/tree/master/getting-started-pingfederate-cluster) | Configuring a PingFed cluster with admin/engine nodes |
| [PingOne for Customer](https://github.com/pingidentity/server-profile-pingidentity-playground/tree/master/pingone-cloud) | Use cases around PingOne for Customer |
